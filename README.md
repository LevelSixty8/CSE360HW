#Homework 2 Assignemnt for CSE 360
I utilised a hashmap to store the quesitons, but as stated in the video, with a brand new VS code on my system I wasn't able to install everything I needed for Java and apologies in that regard.

#Homework 3 Assignment for CSE 360
This project is a submission for Individual Homework 3 in CSE 360. It focuses on automated testing using both standalone mainline logic and JUnit. The application, named HW3, implements and validates five key test cases derived from our Team Project Phase 2 (TP2). These include creating, deleting, and updating questions and answers within a simplified system.

Each test ensures correct functionality, user input validation, and proper interaction with the internal data model. All code is documented using Oracle-style Javadoc, and test results are verifiable through included screencast and test output.
